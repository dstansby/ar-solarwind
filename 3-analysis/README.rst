Data analysis notebooks
=======================

The code needed to reproduce figures in the paper is split into 5 different notebooks.
The numbers at the start of the filename correspond to the figure number that they
reproduce.

Each notebook should be run from start to finish in order. You will need to set the
`data_dir` variable in `helpers_data.py` to point the directory in which the open
field line results are saved in.
